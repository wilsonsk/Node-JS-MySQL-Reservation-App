        UPDATE: 5/22 - Bootstrap makeover + Donor forms updated. Separated into 2 forms. Added business ID to both food and business index pages for reference. Added a way for donee to view a given inventory of a specific donor/business.
                     - Need more clarification from customer as to how to handle flow.
        DISCUSSION TOPIC: 5/22 - Business table needs a unique key, currently there is no way to prevent multiples of the same business
